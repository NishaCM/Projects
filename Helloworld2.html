        <h1><b>About Orchids</b></h1>


        <h2>Description</h2>
        <P class="Bluepara">The orchid family, is a diverse and widespread family of flowering plants, with blooms that
            are often colourful and fragrant.
            Along with the Asteraceae, they are one of the two largest families of flowering plants.
            The Orchidaceae have about 28,000 currently accepted species, distributed in about 763 genera.
            The determination of which family is larger is still under debate, because verified data on the members of
            such enormous families are continually in flux.
            Regardless, the number of orchid species is nearly equal to the number of bony fishes, more than twice the
            number of bird species, and about four times the number of mammal species.
            <p class="Bluepara">
            The family encompasses about 11% of all seed plants.The largest genera are Bulbophyllum (2,000 species),
            Epidendrum (1,500 species), Dendrobium (1,400 species) and Pleurothallis (1,000 species).
            It also includes Vanilla (the genus of the vanilla plant), the type genus Orchis, and many commonly
            cultivated plants such as Phalaenopsis and Cattleya.
            Moreover, since the introduction of tropical species into cultivation in the 19th century, horticulturists
            have produced more than 100,000 hybrids and cultivars.</p>

        <p id="Orange">The Orchidaceae are well known for the many structural variations in their flowers.
            Some orchids have single flowers, but most have a racemose inflorescence, sometimes with a large number of
            flowers.
            The flowering stem can be basal, that is, produced from the base of the tuber, like in Cymbidium, apical,
            meaning it grows from the apex of the main stem,
            like in Cattleya, or axillary, from the leaf axil, as in Vanda.</p>

    <h2>Evolution</h2>
    <div class="Bluepara">
        <p>
            A study in the scientific journal Nature has hypothesised that the origin of orchids goes back much longer
            than originally expected.[16] An extinct species of stingless bee, Proplebeia dominicana, was found trapped
            in Miocene amber from about 15-20 million years ago. The bee was carrying pollen of a previously unknown
            orchid taxon, Meliorchis caribea, on its wings. This find is the first evidence of fossilised orchids to
            date[16] and shows insects were active pollinators of orchids then. This extinct orchid, M. caribea, has
            been placed within the extant tribe Cranichideae, subtribe Goodyerinae (subfamily Orchidoideae). An even
            older orchid species, Succinanthera baltica, was described from the Eocene Baltic amber by Poinar &
            Rasmussen (2017).
        <p>
            Genetic sequencing indicates orchids may have arisen earlier, 76 to 84 million years ago during the Late
            Cretaceous.According to Mark W. Chase et al. (2001), the overall biogeography and phylogenetic patterns of
            Orchidaceae show they are even older and may go back roughly 100 million years.</p>
